In order to get a value from the promise. You have to call a then() function. The then() function registers a callback that will be called when the value has been computed. Its like saying once the promise is processed.. then.. do this. The then() function has two parameters, onFulfilled() and onRejected(). If your asynchronous request was successful onFulfilled() will be called and if the request is not successful onRejected() will be called.
