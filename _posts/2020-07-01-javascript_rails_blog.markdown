Just finished up the Javascript Rails Flat Iron Project. This has been the toughest challenge so far but also very enjoyable. 

From someone who has completed their project I would say to really take the time to practice with fetch requests before

diving in and again make sure you really take the time to plan out each step of your project before you dive in. 

My project which I ended up changing about half a million times after running into issues ended up being a game similar to

frogger or pacman where a user had to move their game piece across the screen to collect items before colliding with an 

evil villan. The game did not turn up to be everything I wanted but Im happy with the outcome and everything I learned in 

the process. Probably one of the hardest parts for me like I said was getting the fetch requests running smoothly. But once

that was in place in was exiting seeing all the doors open for what you could accomplish with this new set of skills. Im Looking forward to what project 4 has in store.
