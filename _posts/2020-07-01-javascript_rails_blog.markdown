Just finished up the Javascript Rails Flat Iron Project. This has been the toughest challenge so far but also very enjoyable. 

I actually started out my project as a game using HTML CANVAS. after many long hours learning how to work with Canvas 
I realized it just was not working for me when it came to what I wanted to accomplish and the project requirements. I would say weeks wasted but in the scheme of things I learned a lot about something I may not have even if it wasnt applying to my project. 

After dabbling in games I landed on the idea of trying out a Quiz. I felt it would lend to the project much better .. and It did! 

I created a silly, fun quiz to identify your spirit animal and although it may seem light simple and goofy I feel that this project has built my skill set the most and challenged me the most out of anything I have tackled on this new coding journey so far. 

I learned a lot about fetch Get and Post requests.. building a rails API and working with javascript functions. 

From someone who has completed their project I would say to really take the time to practice with fetch requests before diving in also read back over scope and sequence and again make sure you really take the time to plan out each step of your project before writing a line of code. It will be stressful but you will make it through!
