Project Numero Dos done and done!

This was a fun one! As I was nearing project week I felt as if I was a bit overwhelmed as the prior weeks had me feeling  like I was pushing in an extensive amount of data into my little brain in a very short amount of time.
I was not sure if I was prepared for the project. 
With the help of the corneal gem for setting up my file structure and the video tutorials and my prior knowledge of starting a project from git in the previous go around.. I got up and running with ease..
I really found this project very enjoyable and had fun with the design aspect, playing around with the look of my app was pretty cool. I liked that it had so many components to it and applying it to something I was passionate about really made me want  to toy around and add more and more things. I hope to go back to this one when I get more time!
I would like to add more attributes and functions. 



My Sinatra App was called CRUX and was meant for climbers as a place where they could save the mountains they have summited into a database and catalog content and descriptions of their climbs. 
As I worked on the project setting up and editing routes and navigating through my webpage through shotgun change after change and edit after edit I really feel like I got a much better sense of all the material I was previously concerned about retaining. I would still like to play around with it more like I said but am really happy with the whole process, what I learned and what I accomplished with the time and how little I knew previous to the last few months. Super Cool!!
