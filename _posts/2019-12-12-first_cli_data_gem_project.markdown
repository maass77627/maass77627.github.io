The first flatiron project.. Oh man its been an intense couple weeks. I have to admit I restarted my project about 5 times just trying to find an API I was'nt running into trouble working with. I Finally got my project up and running with the Studio Ghibli Films API. I decided I would have my project show a list of top Studio Ghibli films and allow the user to request more information on a film they were interested in. The project would then return to the user information on the film that was chosen.

Starting the project..

Initially the feeling was just completely overhwelmed. Looking at all the videos, lessons, example projects etc and then staring at my blank terminal that I had to fill in for the first time on my own.. I just ... bewildered, thats all I can say.. sooo I began devouring videos .. I spent hours and hours watching project set up, how to bundle your project, me and Avi became great friends. I feel like I ran into every problem imaginable but that first success of setting up and bundleing a working environment was a really really good feeling. by the end of it I had bundled 4 seperate projects but hey I guess I got the practice :). 

Now what to do with it. 

I found the daily deal video to be very helpful in the whole process as well as some of the video walk throughs on setting up APIs. I initially tried to use an rspotify API wrapper but was really confused on how to implement it into my project and get it running. I switched to an API from the movie data base website which I kept running into problems getting it to produce anything.. finally I went to studio Ghibli.. I def did not get this one up and running right away but after watching more hours and hours of videos on parsing and JSON etc I was able to produce a Movie object!

From here it was just a matter of coding and testing and coding and testing., I became much more familiar with using pry and just taking things step by step as I tried to build out a CLI class that would run correctly. 

When It was finally all said and done I had a cli class that would greet my user, print out a list of films. It would allow them to type in the index number of the film they would like more information on and then it would print out that movies title, description etc. 

This first project was definitely a huge learning experience for me.. From setting up a gem, working more closely with github,  to producing my own object oriented classes, to working with APIs.. by the end of it I may not have had the project I had envisioned but to have produced something that was working and to look back and see everything I learned in the process I am still feeling a sense of accomplishment. Its not where or what I wanted it to be and I still plan on going back and sorting out details but it taught me a lot!!
