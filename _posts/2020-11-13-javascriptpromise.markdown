Javascript has what we call synchronous code and asynchronous code. Synchronous code runs in order, one step at a time while Asynchronous code is what allows you to do multiple things at one time. Such as if you are making a request for data which could take an unknown amount of time to retrieve.. asynchronous code allows other code to continue executing while your data request is being processed. When using asynchronous code you will hear of something called a promise. A promise is the return value of an asynchronous function. Since an async function does not always immediately return a final value a promise is what holds that place until it has fully processed. A promise in javascript works very much like a promise in real life. It is promising some future data. A promise in javascript can be unresolved, meaning it is still pending, resolved, meaning it returned a value, or rejected, meaning the request was unsuccessful.
